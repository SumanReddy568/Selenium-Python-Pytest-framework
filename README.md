# Python Selenium pytest Framework

This is a Python Selenium pytest framework designed for automated testing of web applications. Frameworks provide a structured approach to software development, and in the context of testing, they offer a systematic way to organize, execute, and maintain tests.

## Framework Overview

The framework follows a modular architecture and utilizes several key components:

1. **pytest**: pytest is a popular testing framework for Python that provides a simple yet powerful way to write and execute tests. It offers features such as fixture management, parameterized testing, and test discovery.

2. **Selenium**: Selenium is a widely-used tool for automating web browsers. It allows testers to simulate user interactions with web applications, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and verifying page content.

3. **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance test maintainability and readability. POM separates the page elements and their interactions into individual classes, making it easier to manage changes in the UI.

4. **Configuration Management**: Test parameters and settings are stored in a separate configuration file (`config.ini`). This allows users to customize test behavior without modifying the test code.

5. **Reporting**: After test execution, detailed test reports are generated in HTML format (`reports/report.html`). These reports provide insights into test results, including passed tests, failed tests, and any errors encountered during execution.

## Benefits of the Framework

- **Modularity**: The framework's modular structure promotes code reusability and maintainability. Test scripts, page objects, and utility functions are organized into separate modules, making it easier to manage and update individual components.

- **Scalability**: The framework can scale to accommodate larger test suites and complex web applications. pytest's flexible test discovery mechanism allows tests to be organized and executed efficiently, even as the test suite grows.

- **Ease of Use**: With its intuitive syntax and powerful features, pytest simplifies the process of writing and executing tests. Test scripts are written in plain Python, making them easy to understand and maintain.

- **Integration**: The framework seamlessly integrates with other tools and technologies commonly used in the software development lifecycle. This includes continuous integration servers like Jenkins, version control systems like Git, and containerization platforms like Docker.

This section provides an organized view of the project's directory structure, with brief descriptions of each file and directory's purpose. It helps users understand how the project is organized and where to find specific components.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure Python is installed. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Customize test parameters in `config.ini`.

4. **Writing Tests**: Create test scripts under `tests/`. Utilize Page Object Model (POM) for better organization.

5. **Running Tests**: Execute tests using pytest:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

6. **Viewing Reports**: Open `reports/report.html` after test execution.

## Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

This framework includes a Jenkins pipeline configuration (`Jenkinsfile`) for continuous integration. The pipeline consists of stages for building, testing, and reporting. Jenkins fetches the code from the repository, builds the Docker image, runs tests inside a container, and generates reports.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-test-image .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run my-test-image pytest'
            }
        }
        stage('Report') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker cp $(docker ps -q -n=1):/path/to/reports ./reports'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Docker Containerization

The framework supports Docker containerization for easy setup and execution. The `Dockerfile` defines the Docker image, including dependencies and test execution environment. To build and run tests inside a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t my-test-image .
docker run my-test-image pytest
```

The Docker container automatically handles the setup and execution of tests, ensuring consistency across environments.
